# 🧠 Predictive Healthcare: User Behavior & Outcome Modeling

This project combines two important domains in healthcare AI:
1. **mHealth User Behavior Prediction**: Mining app usage patterns to predict user interactions.
2. **Patient Outcome Prediction**: Using ML to predict clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, progression).

## 📁 Modules

### 1. Behavior Modeling (`behavior_modeling/`)
- SIM (Similarity Inference Model)
- Max-Miner (Frequent Transaction Mining)
- GIT-Tree (Frequent Itemsets)
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for behavior prediction

### 2. Outcome Modeling (`outcome_modeling/`)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

---

## 📊 Datasets

- `synthetic_mhealth_data.csv`: Simulated mobile health transaction logs
- `synthetic_patient_data.csv`: Synthetic clinical features and outcomes

---

## 📦 Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📈 Results

Models are evaluated using common metrics. Results are visualized using matplotlib/seaborn.
